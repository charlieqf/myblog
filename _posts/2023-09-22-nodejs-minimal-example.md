Creating a Simple Node.js Web App with Express

In the ever-evolving world of web development, Node.js has emerged as a powerhouse for backend development. Paired with the Express framework, creating a web app becomes streamlined and efficient. In this blog post, we will walk you through creating a simple Node.js web app using Express, step by step.

1. Setting Up Your Environment
Before we dive into the coding part, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If not, download and install them from the official Node.js website.

2. Initializing a New Project
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Node.js project:

mkdir nodejs_example
cd nodejs_example

Initialize a new Node.js project:

npm init -y

This command will create a package.json file with default values, acting as the blueprint for your project.

3. Installing Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Install it as follows:

npm install express --save

4. Building Your Web Server
Create a new file named server.js in your project directory:

touch server.js

Open this file in your preferred text editor and add the following code:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

In this code:

We import the Express library.
Create an instance of the Express app.
Set up a basic route for the root URL (/) to display "Hello, World!".
Start the server to listen on port 3000.
5. Running the Web App
Back in your terminal or command prompt:

node server.js

If everything is set up correctly, you should see: Server is running on http://localhost:3000. Open up your browser and navigate to this URL. Voila! Your simple Node.js web app using Express is now live.

6. Conclusion & Further Reading
Creating a web app using Node.js and Express is straightforward, especially for beginners. This example provides a foundation upon which you can expand and build more complex applications.

For those looking to delve deeper into Express and its capabilities:

Explore the official Express documentation.
